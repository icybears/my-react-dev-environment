 add this:
 "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --open"
  }
  
  and now to start everything: npm run start.
  webpack-dev-serer will open up in the browser (it also reloads at every change in the files automatically)
  
  (don't forget to add "babel" property with the presets in the package.json)
